# 📈 Market Dataset – Data Cleaning and Price Trend Visualization

Understanding Market Behavior through Historical Financial Data and Preprocessing Techniques

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Financial data analysis is a critical step in uncovering market behavior, recognizing trading patterns, and informing economic decisions. This project uses a comprehensive **Market Dataset** that includes key financial indicators such as **Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume** to study price movements over time.

The primary focus of this project is **data cleaning** — ensuring data accuracy by addressing missing values, outliers, and noise. Once cleaned, the data is visualized to explore trading trends and highlight fluctuations in stock prices and volumes.

This analysis sets the stage for deeper financial modeling and provides insights for traders, economists, and data scientists interested in market analytics.
